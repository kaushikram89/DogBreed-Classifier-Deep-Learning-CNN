# DogBreed-Classifier-Deep-Learning-CNN

# Introduction
This project is part of Udacity deep learning course to identify dog breeds on a set of dog images. The network also differentiates humans from dogs.

# Instructions
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.

	```git clone https://github.com/kaushikram89/DogBreed-Classifier-Deep-Learning-CNN.git``` <br>
	```cd DogBreed-Classifier-Deep-Learning-CNN```


2. Download the [dog](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) datasetDownload the dog datase. Unzip the folder and place it in this project's home directory, at the location data/dog_images

3. Download the [human](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz) dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the home directory, at location data/lfw. If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use 7zip to extract the folder.

4. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Type in the terminal 
```jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb``` to open the notebook.

5. My saved models are in the saved_models folder.
